Do not rush when you just started learning.
Speed up only when your fingers hit the right keys out of habit.
Take your time when typing to avoid mistakes.
The speed will pick up as you progress.
Always scan the text a word or two in advance.
Study for Endsem examination, else you will Fail.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
All the best for Endsem.
Every child likes an ice cream.
Miracles happen to those who believe in them.
Positive anything is better than negative nothing.
